## Notes

At first, applying CSS to the cards and passing props was pretty tough. I had trouble with the layout and making the cards look good on different screen sizes. I spent some time experimenting with flexbox and grid to get it right. Passing props between components also took a bit of practice, but I learned how to manage state and props better as I went. Overall, this project helped me improve my CSS skills and my understanding of how to work with components in frontend development.
